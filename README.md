## About Me

Hello, I'm **Kaleb**. I'm from **America (USA)**. ![GIF]()

I know languages like **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **PHP**, and **Java**. I've been making little projects for fun for a couple of years now.

As I mentioned, I started coding a few years ago and have been doing it ever since!

### How I Learned
I'm a self-taught programmer, and I learned using resources like:
- **W3Schools**
- **Stack Overflow**
- **YouTube**
- **Google**

the typical self-taught programmer sterotype.
